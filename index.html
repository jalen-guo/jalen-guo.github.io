      <h2>About In n' Out</h2>
        <p>The first In n' Out opened in 1948. The genius behind all of this is Harry Snyder. The original location in California was only about 100 square feet big.</p>
        <p>Snyder's store was the first to integrate a two-way speaker system in their drive-thrus, revolutionizing the fast food industry</p>
